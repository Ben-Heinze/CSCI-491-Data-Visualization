## Homework 2

### download repo

First go to your desktop or where ever you'd like to store the repository

`git clone git@github.com:Ben-Heinze/CSCI-347-Datamining.git`

This will download a version of the repository to your local machine.

`git remote add upstream git@github.com:Ben-Heinze/CSCI-347-Datamining.git`

This will allow you to update the online repository. 

Verify the new upstream repository you've specified for your fork.

```
$ git remote -v
> origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (fetch)
> origin    https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_FORK.git (push)
> upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (fetch)
> upstream  https://github.com/ORIGINAL_OWNER/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git (push)
```

From there, you'd be able to
* add your changes with `git add *`
* commit with `git commit -m "message here."`
* push with `git push`
* and pull new updates with `git pull`
